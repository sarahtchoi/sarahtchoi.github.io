My name is Sarah Choi and I have an interesting story to tell. You see, I am a storyteller. Some people call us product managers, but I think we really are there to tell the story of our customers. And I am passionate about the stories I get to tell. 

As a storyteller, I have a few guiding principles. So before I tell stories I always keep in mind the following:
1. Carefully listen to the story you are going to retell -- understand the 'Why'
2. Don't build something you won't use -- always be clear on the 'What' 
3. Never tell the story of 'How' to build something
4. Don't retell a shitty story
